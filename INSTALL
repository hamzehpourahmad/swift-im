Prerequisites
-------------
You should have development version of gtkmm (>= 2.16.x). 
See http://www.gtkmm.org/download.shtml for detailed instructions.

CMake (>= 2.6) binary distribution.
See http://www.cmake.org for detailed instructions.


Compiling and installing
------------------------
1.  `cd` to the directory containing the package's source code.
2.  run `./cmake .` to configure the package for your system. This will generate Makefile. Note that "." (dot symbol)
     represents current directory. Without it the command won't work!
3.  run `make` to compile the package.
4.  (as root) run `make install` to install Swift-IM. 

By default, `make install` will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/share', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local` by running `cmake` command
with '-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=INSTALL_PATH' option. This will change 
installation prefix to INSTALL_PATH. 
For example type `./cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/another/path .`
for installing package into /another/path.

You can specify generator used for building package by passing '-G <GENERATOR_NAME>'
option to `cmake` command. Run `cmake --help` for detailed help and list of available
generators. It is recommended to use 'Unix Makefiles' under Linux and 
'MinGW Makefiles' under Windows.

To reconfigure package (i.e. generate new Makefile) delete CMakeCache.txt
file from package directory and run `./cmake .` command again.


Running
-------
1.  run `swift-im` from directory you have chosen for installation.
